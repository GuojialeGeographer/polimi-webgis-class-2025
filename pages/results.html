													<h3>Key Air Quality Indicators</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Our analysis focused on the following key air pollutants, which have significant health implications:</p>
												<ul class="default">
													<li><strong>PM2.5</strong> - Fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5 μm)</li>
													<li><strong>PM10</strong> - Coarse particulate matter (&lt;10 μm)</li>
													<li><strong>NO2</strong> - Nitrogen dioxide</li>
													<li><strong>O3</strong> - Ozone</li>
													<li><strong>SO2</strong> - Sulfur dioxide</li>
													<li><strong>CO</strong> - Carbon monoxide</li>

													<h3>Air Quality Index (AQI) Levels</h3>
												</header>
												<p>The AQI is calculated based on the concentration levels of multiple pollutants and categorized into six levels:</p>
												<ul class="default">
													<li><strong style="color: #00E400;">Good (0-50)</strong>: Little to no health risk</li>
													<li><strong style="color: #FFFF00;">Moderate (51-100)</strong>: Acceptable quality</li>
													<li><strong style="color: #FF7E00;">Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150)</strong>: May affect sensitive individuals</li>
													<li><strong style="color: #FF0000;">Unhealthy (151-200)</strong>: Everyone may experience health effects</li>
													<li><strong style="color: #99004C;">Very Unhealthy (201-300)</strong>: Health alert - risk for all</li>
													<li><strong style="color: #7E0023;">Hazardous (301+)</strong>: Emergency conditions</li>

													<h3>Spatial Distribution of Air Pollution</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Our analysis revealed distinct spatial patterns in air pollution across Greece. Key findings include:</p>
												
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Urban Centers</strong>: The highest concentrations of NO2 and CO were observed in Athens, Thessaloniki, and other major cities, with levels frequently exceeding European Union air quality standards during peak traffic hours and summer months.</li>
													<li><strong>Industrial Zones</strong>: Areas around Attica, Thessaloniki, and Patras showed elevated levels of PM10, PM2.5, and SO2, particularly in areas with high industrial activity and port operations.</li>
													<li><strong>Coastal Tourist Areas</strong>: Popular destinations like Crete, Rhodes, and the Cyclades islands experience significant seasonal variations in air quality, with notable deterioration during peak tourist seasons (June-September).</li>
													<li><strong>Rural and Mountainous Regions</strong>: Generally better air quality, though occasionally affected by long-range transport of pollutants and seasonal agricultural burning.</li>
													<li><strong>Island Communities</strong>: Varying pollution profiles, with some smaller islands maintaining excellent air quality while larger islands with significant tourism or shipping activity showing moderate pollution levels.</li>
												</ul>
												
												<p>Interpolation analysis of monitoring station data revealed that approximately 42% of Greece's population lives in areas where annual average PM2.5 levels exceed the World Health Organization recommended guidelines of 5 μg/m³, primarily in urban and industrialized regions.</p>

													<div class="col-6">
														<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="../images/seasonal-variation.jpg" alt="" /></a>
													</div>
													<div class="col-6">
														<p>Our temporal analysis identified significant seasonal and regional patterns in air pollution:</p>
														<ul>
															<li><strong>Winter Patterns</strong>: Urban areas show elevated levels of PM2.5 and PM10 during winter months (December-February), primarily due to residential heating with wood and fossil fuels, especially in northern regions and mountainous areas.</li>
															<li><strong>Summer Tourism Impact</strong>: Coastal areas and islands experience up to 35% increase in NO2 and ground-level ozone during summer tourist season due to increased traffic, energy consumption, and maritime activities.</li>
															<li><strong>Wildfire Season</strong>: Late summer (July-September) often sees dramatic spikes in particulate matter across large regions during wildfire events, creating temporary but severe air quality deterioration.</li>
															<li><strong>Shipping Influence</strong>: Major port cities and shipping lanes show consistent patterns of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions throughout the year, with intensification during cruise ship season.</li>

													<h3>Pollution Sources and Contributing Factors</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Through correlation analysis and spatial association studies, we identified the primary sources and factors contributing to air pollution in Greece:</p>
												
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Road Transportation (32-40%)</strong>: The dominant source of NO2 and a significant contributor to PM10 and PM2.5 in urban areas, with Athens and Thessaloniki showing the highest impact.</li>
													<li><strong>Maritime Activities (15-25%)</strong>: A major source of SO2 and NOx emissions in coastal areas and island communities, particularly near major ports like Piraeus, Thessaloniki, and Patras.</li>
													<li><strong>Residential Heating (20-30%)</strong>: Significant contributor to wintertime particulate matter pollution, especially in northern Greece and mountainous regions where wood burning is common.</li>
													<li><strong>Industrial Activities (10-15%)</strong>: Concentrated in specific zones around Athens, Thessaloniki, and other industrial centers.</li>
													<li><strong>Agricultural Activities (5-10%)</strong>: Seasonal contributor to particulate matter and ammonia, particularly during burning periods and fertilizer application.</li>
													<li><strong>Long-range Transport (5-15%)</strong>: Saharan dust events periodically affect air quality across Greece, especially in southern regions and islands.</li>
													<li><strong>Wildfires (variable)</strong>: Seasonal contributor that can temporarily become the dominant source during major fire events.</li>
												</ul>
												
												<header>
													<h3>Population Exposure and Health Risk Assessment</h3>
												</header>
												
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="../images/exposure-map.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												
												<p>By overlaying pollution data with population density and demographic information, we assessed population exposure to air pollution:</p>
												
												<ul>
													<li>Approximately 4.5 million people (42% of Greece's population) live in areas where annual average PM2.5 levels exceed EU standards, primarily in urban centers and their surrounding areas.</li>
													<li>Athens metropolitan area shows the highest collective exposure, with over 3 million residents experiencing elevated pollution levels, particularly in central and western districts.</li>
													<li>Seasonal tourist destinations face transient but significant increases in exposed populations during summer months, with some islands seeing their effective "exposure population" triple during peak season.</li>
													<li>Vulnerable populations (children under 5, adults over 65, and those with pre-existing respiratory conditions) comprise approximately 2.1 million individuals, with higher concentrations in urban centers and aging rural communities.</li>
													<li>Schools and healthcare facilities in high-pollution zones were identified as priority areas for intervention, particularly in dense urban neighborhoods and areas adjacent to major traffic corridors.</li>
												</ul>
												
												<p>Our health risk model, based on established exposure-response relationships, estimated that reducing PM2.5 levels to WHO guidelines across Greece could prevent approximately 3,200 premature deaths annually and significantly reduce respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations.</p>
