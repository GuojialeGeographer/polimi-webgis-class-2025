													<h3>Key Air Quality Indicators</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Our analysis focused on the following key air pollutants, which have significant health implications:</p>
												<ul class="default">
													<li><strong>PM2.5</strong> - Fine particulate matter (&lt;2.5 μm)</li>
													<li><strong>PM10</strong> - Coarse particulate matter (&lt;10 μm)</li>
													<li><strong>NO2</strong> - Nitrogen dioxide</li>
													<li><strong>O3</strong> - Ozone</li>
													<li><strong>SO2</strong> - Sulfur dioxide</li>
													<li><strong>CO</strong> - Carbon monoxide</li>
												</ul>

													<h3>Air Quality Index (AQI) Levels</h3>
												</header>
												<p>The AQI is calculated based on the concentration levels of multiple pollutants and categorized into six levels:</p>
												<ul class="default">
													<li><strong style="color: #00E400;">Good (0-50)</strong>: Little to no health risk</li>
													<li><strong style="color: #FFFF00;">Moderate (51-100)</strong>: Acceptable quality</li>
													<li><strong style="color: #FF7E00;">Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150)</strong>: May affect sensitive individuals</li>
													<li><strong style="color: #FF0000;">Unhealthy (151-200)</strong>: Everyone may experience health effects</li>
													<li><strong style="color: #99004C;">Very Unhealthy (201-300)</strong>: Health alert - risk for all</li>
													<li><strong style="color: #7E0023;">Hazardous (301+)</strong>: Emergency conditions</li>

													<h3>Spatial Distribution of Air Pollution</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Our analysis revealed distinct spatial patterns in air pollution across the Milan metropolitan area. Key findings include:</p>
												
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Central Urban Areas</strong>: The highest concentrations of NO2 and CO were observed in the city center and along major traffic corridors, with levels frequently exceeding European Union air quality standards during peak traffic hours.</li>
													<li><strong>Industrial Zones</strong>: Areas in the northern and eastern industrial districts showed elevated levels of PM10, PM2.5, and SO2, particularly during weekdays when industrial activity is highest.</li>
													<li><strong>Suburban Residential Areas</strong>: Generally better air quality compared to the urban core, but still showed moderate levels of particulate matter, especially during winter months due to residential heating.</li>
													<li><strong>Green Spaces</strong>: Parks and urban forests demonstrated significantly lower pollution levels, highlighting their importance as "clean air islands" within the urban environment.</li>
												</ul>
												
												<p>Interpolation analysis of monitoring station data revealed that approximately 68% of the Milan metropolitan area experiences annual average PM2.5 levels above the World Health Organization recommended guidelines of 5 μg/m³.</p>

													<h3>Temporal Patterns and Seasonal Variations</h3>
												</header>
												
												<div class="row">
													<div class="col-6">
														<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="../images/seasonal-variation.jpg" alt="" /></a>
													</div>
													<div class="col-6">
														<p>Our temporal analysis identified significant seasonal and daily patterns in air pollution:</p>
														<ul>
															<li><strong>Winter Peaks</strong>: PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were 2-3 times higher during winter months (November-February) compared to summer, due to increased heating, reduced atmospheric mixing, and temperature inversions.</li>
															<li><strong>Summer Ozone</strong>: O3 levels peaked during summer months, especially during heatwaves, due to photochemical reactions accelerated by high temperatures and solar radiation.</li>
															<li><strong>Daily Patterns</strong>: Two distinct peaks in NO2 and CO levels were observed daily, corresponding to morning (7-9 AM) and evening (5-7 PM) rush hours.</li>
															<li><strong>Weekend Effect</strong>: A noticeable reduction (15-30%) in most pollutant levels during weekends compared to weekdays, reflecting reduced traffic and industrial activity.</li>
														</ul>

													<h3>Pollution Sources and Contributing Factors</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Through correlation analysis and spatial association studies, we identified the primary sources and factors contributing to air pollution in Milan:</p>
												
												<ul>
													<li><strong>Traffic (38-45%)</strong>: The dominant source of NO2 and a significant contributor to PM10 and PM2.5. Areas within 300m of major roadways showed 28-35% higher pollution levels.</li>
													<li><strong>Residential Heating (25-30%)</strong>: Particularly significant during winter months, contributing to elevated PM2.5 levels across residential areas.</li>
													<li><strong>Industrial Activities (15-20%)</strong>: Concentrated in specific zones and contributing primarily to SO2 and particulate matter.</li>
													<li><strong>Meteorological Factors</strong>: Wind speed showed a strong negative correlation with pollutant concentrations (r = -0.72), while temperature inversions were associated with pollution episodes during winter.</li>
													<li><strong>Urban Form</strong>: Areas with high building density and narrow street canyons showed reduced pollutant dispersion and 18-25% higher concentration levels.</li>
												</ul>
												
												<header>
													<h3>Population Exposure and Health Risk Assessment</h3>
												</header>
												
												<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="../images/exposure-map.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												
												<p>By overlaying pollution data with population density and demographic information, we assessed population exposure to air pollution:</p>
												
												<ul>
													<li>Approximately 1.2 million people (45% of the metropolitan population) live in areas where annual average PM2.5 levels exceed EU standards.</li>
													<li>Urban districts with high population density often coincide with areas of elevated pollution, resulting in significant collective exposure.</li>
													<li>Vulnerable populations (children under 5, adults over 65, and those with pre-existing respiratory conditions) are disproportionately affected, with an estimated 320,000 individuals at high risk.</li>
													<li>Schools and healthcare facilities located in high-pollution zones were identified as priority areas for intervention.</li>
												</ul>
												
												<p>Our health risk model, based on established exposure-response relationships, estimated that reducing PM2.5 levels to WHO guidelines could prevent approximately 1,500 premature deaths annually in the Milan metropolitan area.</p>
